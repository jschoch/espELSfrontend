Referenced from https://medium.com/how-to-react/convert-your-existing-react-js-app-to-android-or-ios-app-using-the-ionic-capacitor-a127deda75bd

- install ionic globally
-- (optional) use the Iconic extension for visual studio code, by ionic.io
-- npm install -g @ionic/cli
- install electron
-- npm install -g electron
- build the npm project
-- npm run build
- run the electron app
-- nagivate to the electron dir in this project
